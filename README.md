# What
This is my modpack for World of Tanks, a couple of mods that I use to make the game more enjoyable, but sometimes the mods won't be updated, which in that case i'll leave the link to Plazmakeks or Wargaming mod portal, since they updates the mods more often.

Mod list:
- [Distance Marker](https://wgmods.net/6662/)
- [Battle Hits](https://wgmods.net/5912/)
- [Auto Claim Tour of Duty Missions](https://pkmods.com/auto-claim-tour-of-duty-missions-by-anne_domini/)
- [~~Server Reticle~~](https://pkmods.com/awfultanker-server-reticle/) (Deprecated on version 1.12.1.1)

# Ok, but why
I wanted to use my knowledge in git to create this modpack, and also to make it easier to install the mods, since you can just clone the repository and that's it.

# How to use
## Prerequisites
- [Git bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## Installation
- Go to your World of Tanks folder, usually located at `C:\Games\World_of_Tanks_NA`
-  Right click on the folder and select `Git Bash Here`
- Run the following command:
```git clone https://github.com/Peristroff/peristroff-wot-modpack```
- Done! Now you have the mods installed.
